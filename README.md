# easier-proves
A project which aim to help engineers to make proofs easily

## TODO/REPORT
1. Fow now, left and right part of the assertion are string, maybe change that and refine.
2. For now, we specify the number of case at hand for "case" kind of proof. Maybe analyse myself the sum types ?

## Kind of proofs possible
1. "one shot" proofs for equality and inequality are made (solvable with auto/discriminate)
2. "case/destruct" simple proofs (all cases are solvable with auto)
