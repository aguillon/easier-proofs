# Build examples

## Generate 

To generate the proofs by using easier-proofs do:

`ruby generate.rb path_1 path_2 path_3`

where:

- `path_1` is the path of easier-proofs
- `path_2` is the path of the examples
- `path_3` is the path of the specific examples that you want to proof.

This command does 3 things:
- Use `coq-of-ocaml` to generate the file(s) `*.ml` to `*.v`
- Then use the easier-proofs to generate the proofs for `*.v` (the proofs is defined in the file for example: `examples/nat/bin/main.ml`). The lemmas will be added after the definitions of `*.v` (generated by `coq-of-ocaml` step).
- Create the `_CoqProject` and `Makefile` 

For example:

To generate the proofs by using easier-proofs for natural numbers (`easier-proofs/examples/nat`) do:

`ruby generate.rb ~/easier-proofs examples nat`

Finally, to compile the `Coq` files do: `make`

## Clean up

For cleanup the generated files do:
`ruby cleanup.rb path_1 path_2 path_3`

where `path_1, path_2, path_3` are the same as before.

For example, clean up the generated files for natural numbers above:

`ruby cleanup.rb ~/easier-proofs examples nat`

it will do `make clean`, to clean up the `Coq` compiled files, remove the generated `Coq` file (in this case is `Nat.v`), remove the `_CoqProject`, and `Makefile`.
